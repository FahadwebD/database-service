Asthma is also the No. 1 reason kids are admitted to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. It’s important to understand what your child’s early warning signs are, what triggers his asthma attacks, the types of medications he should take and how to create an asthma action plan.",

In a child with asthma, airways react to certain triggers, causing: The airways to swell.Thick, sticky mucus to fill the airways. The muscles that wrap around the airways to squeez tight.
